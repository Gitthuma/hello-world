<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>My name is George Githuma or if you like
  BabyElephant and I will be your captain
  for this journey. I dont normally do this,
  but as they say, there is a first time to
  everything. The journey might be a bit rough
  and bumpy, but what is an adventure without
  that? :)... We will figure it out together,
  which also means, More Fun! At the end of
  this, we will have a World Class website,
  World Class is the key word folks.
  So hop on to The BabyElephant ;), and lets
  go on a ride :)...</p>
